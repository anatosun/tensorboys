## Pattern Recognition task 4

# Sigature verification with Dynamic Time Warping

Our model establishes a SVM for each user based on the dissimilarity between the verification set and the enrollment set. We reach an accuracy of 88.52 %. The results vary with the users, probably because the signature are less consistent.
